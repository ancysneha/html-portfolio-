<p>Hi, I’m Ancy Sneha, a third-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in web development and building user-friendly digital experiences. Over the past few years, I’ve been developing my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.

I enjoy turning ideas into responsive, interactive websites and applications. Whether it’s a personal project, a class assignment, or freelance work, I approach every project with curiosity, problem-solving, and a commitment to clean code and good design.

I’m currently looking for internship or part-time opportunities where I can contribute, learn from experienced developers, and grow as a full-stack web developer.</p>
